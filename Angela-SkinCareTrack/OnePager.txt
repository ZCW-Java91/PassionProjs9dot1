Are you tired of the guesswork in your skincare routine? Wish you could simply track which products you used and when?
Say goodbye to the confusion and frustration with SkinCareTrack (or TBD), the ultimate app that is designed to simplify
your skincare routine.

SkinCareTrack is an app that allows you to add in the products you use and record your skincare routine for each day,
segmented into your morning and evening routines. You will register an account where you will provide your name,
username, and password. Input your skincare products with their brand, name, type, and an image. After setting a
routine, you can update it by adding more products or deleting the ones you decided to not use.

I will make this app using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Angular (maybe).
