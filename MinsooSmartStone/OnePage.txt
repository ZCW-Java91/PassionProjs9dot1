Smart Stone is a web based application that lets the user input certain qualities of their kitchen knife
And receive recommendation on what the user should use it order to sharpen and maintain their knife.

The user inputs:
The size (90 mm, 160 mm, 210 mm) ,
Rockwell Hardness Level,
Knife style (Chefs knife (Gyuto), Sushi knife (Yanagiba), Petty knife, Cleaver, etc)
Metal type (High carbon, stainless steel, hight zinc),
Number of bevels (Single or double),
Level of current sharpness ((High)  5 to 1 (Dull))
And desired outcome “category” (Work horse, laser, butcher).

And the application will tell you:
What stones to use (Grit level and polishing agent),
What angle to sharpen in (Range of degrees),skull
What food to avoid cutting.

You just bought yourself a brand new chef’s knife, maybe it was through the swindle of the street vendor or maybe it was from hours of meticulous research. You feel amazing as you feel glide and slice through protein and veg. But after a while, you start to notice the sharpness dwindle. What a travesty. You must correct the growing offense against the crafters of this blade. But how? Where do you start? You poured your all into the knife but not to the after care. Don’t worry, Smart Stone will help you get a running start.

Spring, Java, SQL and Javascript.
